The SVD is used for dimension reduction, trend analysis, and potentially for the clustering of a multivariate dataset. SVD is an exploratory approach to the data analysis and therefore it is an unsuprevised approach. In other words, you will only need the X block matrix. However, where the Y matrix/vector is available, it (i.e. Y) can be used for building composit models or assess the quality of the clustering.

The matrix U_m times n is the left singular matrix and it represents a rotation in the matrix space. The D_{n \\times n} is diagonal matrix and contains the singular values. This matix may be indicated with different symbols such as Sigma_n times n. The D_n times n matrix in the geometrical space represents an act of stratching. Each singular value is the degree and/or weight of stratching. We use the notation D_{n \\times n} to remind ourselves that this is a diagonal matrix. Finally, V_{n \\times n}^{T} is called the right singular matrix and is associated with rotation. Overall, SVD geometrically is a combination of a rotation, a stratching, and a second rotation.","category":"page"},{"location":"svd/","page":"SVD","title":"SVD","text":"The two matrics U_{m \\times n} and V_{n \\times n}^{T} are very special due to their unitary properties.","category":"page"},{"location":"svd/","page":"SVD","title":"SVD","text":"\\begin{equation}","category":"page"},{"location":"svd/","page":"SVD","title":"SVD","text":"U","category":"page"},{"location":"svd/","page":"SVD","title":"SVD","text":"\\end{equation}","category":"page"},{"location":"#Advanced-Statistics-and-Chemometrics-(ACS)","page":"Home","title":"Advanced Statistics and Chemometrics (ACS)","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A documentation built for the ACS course to help the students during the lectures and for exame preparation ","category":"page"}]
